                    <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well
                        and
                        where it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to

                        this design more efficient?”</p>

                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
                <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved
                    but also make
                    revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                <h3>Design Report</h3>
                <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report
                    with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
                </p>
                <h3>Ways to Redesign</h3>
                <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to
                    high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
                    and quick but effective improvements.</p>
